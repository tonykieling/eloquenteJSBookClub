 * FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
 * 
 * A function is considered a first-class member when it can be declared as a variable and sent to functions as an argument. These functions can even be returned from functions.
 * 
 * functional programming techniques, including arrow functions, promises, and the spread operator.

// // functions as an array element
// const messages = [
//   "They can be inserted into arrays",
//   message => console.log(message),
//   "like variables",
//   message => console.log(message)
// ];
// messages[1](messages[0]);
// messages[3](messages[2]);


// // Functions can be sent to other functions as arguments, just like other variables:
// const insideFn = logger => {
//   console.log("logger = ", logger.toString())
//   logger("They can be sent to other functions as arguments");
// };
// insideFn(message => console.log(message));

// // similar as above
// ((x = "test text") => console.log(x))();


// They can also be returned from other functions, just like variables:
// also similar as the above
// const createScream = logger => message => logger(message.toUpperCase() + "!!!");
//more details from the line above:
const createScream = logger => {
  console.log("1- logger::", logger.toString());
  return message => {
    console.log("2- message::", message);
    logger(message.toUpperCase() + "!!!");

//If you see more than one arrow used during a function declaration, this means that youâ€™re using a higher-order function.

// We can say that JavaScript supports functional programming because its functions are first-class citizens. 
// This means that functions are data. They can be saved, retrieved, or flow through your applications just like variables.
