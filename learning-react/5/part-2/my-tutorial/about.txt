this app worked!!

I used the app example from the book and the settings from 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-deploy-your-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-and-babel-a669891033d4/

I followed the tutorial up to "Adding Prettier" (not including it)

*** there is an adjustment in package.json:
- instead of:
"scripts": {
 "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development",
},
- do:
"scripts": {
 "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
},
